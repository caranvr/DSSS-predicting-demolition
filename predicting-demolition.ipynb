    "\n",

    "## Presentation of Data\n",
    "### Data collection\n",
    "Data on demolitions, property-level, and neighbourhood-level characteristics was collected from various local and federal government sources. Given the large number of properties included in the dataset (over 500,000) and the number of features attached to each property (42), executing the code for data collection takes a considerable amount of time. This section therefore omits the full code, instead outlining the data collection process in detail. The code described in this section can be found in a separate notebook on [Github](https://github.com/caranvr/DSSS-predicting-demolition/blob/main/data-collection-code.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demolitions\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Philadelphia's Licenses and Inspections Department maintains a database of all demolition permits in the city issued since 2007. The addresses associated with private demolition permits from 2018-2021 were extracted, as public demolitions are more reflective of structural issues than consumer demand (Weber et al., 2006). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Property characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Philadelphia's Office of Property Assessments (OPA) maintains a regularly updated, georeferenced database of city properties, which contains building characteristics used to assess property tax rates. Due to the large size of the dataset, this database was accessed through an API call. Based on property characteristics found by Weber et al. (2006) to predict demolition risk, the following (non-identifying) features were selected:\n",
    "- **interior_condition**: a numeric code representing the quality of a property's interior. Properties are rated on a scale of 2 to 7, with 2 corresponding to \"noticeably new construction\" and 7 corresponding to \"structurally compromised\" (City of Philadelphia, 2021). A value of 0 indicates vacant land. \n",
    "- **exterior_condition**: a numeric code representing the property's external appearance, using the same scale as *interior_condition*. \n",
    "- **total_area**: the total area of the property.\n",
    "- **year_built**: the year the property was built.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match properties to Census tracts and find distances to relevant attractions, the latitude and longitude of each property were requested as well. In addition, **category_code_description** was selected, as Weber et al. (2006) only looked at single-family residential property demolition. Commercial, industrial, or multi-family residential properties may have different predictors of demolition risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most comprehensive property dataset is the most recent one. However, for 86.3% of properties with an associated demolition permit, the property assessment on file is from prior to demolition, or the building has not yet been demolished. The remaining properties have been re-assessed since their demolition and are now listed as vacant land. Since the model includes building characteristics, and these features are null for properties classed as 'Vacant Land', all properties in this category were dropped from the dataset. The remaining properties were matched against the demolition dataset to identify whether or not a demolition permit was attached to them after 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "A separate OPA dataset was used to find each property's market value in 2018, then joined to the main properties dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distance attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with Ding and Hwang (2016), City Hall was used as a proxy for the city centre. The geopandas library was used to calculate the distance from each property to City Hall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the distance from each property to its closest public transport stop was more involved, as there is no single shapefile of all public transport stops in the city. Therefore, shapefiles of commuter rail, subway, and trolley stops were downloaded and concatenated into one dataframe. This dataframe was then converted into a binary search tree using scipy's cKDTree method, which allowed for quick spatial querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neighbourhood attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this analysis, neighbourhoods were defined as U.S. Census tracts, which have an average population of 4,000 residents (Oka and Wong, 2016). For status variables, \n"
